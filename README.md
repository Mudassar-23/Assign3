RLC Circuit Analyzer

Description
This C++ program simulates RLC (Resistor-Inductor-Capacitor) circuits and analyzes their behavior. It defines classes for Complex numbers and RLC_Circuit objects.

Features:
Performs complex number arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Analyzes RLC circuits (series and parallel)
Calculates impedance, resonant frequency, total current, and real power
User-friendly input and output
Supports multiple circuit analysis

Usage
The program prompts you for your roll number and the number of RLC circuits to analyze. For each circuit:
Enter the circuit's component values (resistance, inductance, capacitance, frequency).
Choose the circuit type (series or parallel).

The program then displays the following results for each circuit:
Equivalent Impedance (real and imaginary parts)
Resonant Frequency
Total Current (real and imaginary parts)
Real Power
